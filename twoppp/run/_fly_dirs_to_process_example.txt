# fly dirs to be selected for preprocessing and which tasks to run on them
# example configs below:
# general format:
# fly_dir||selected trials (either 'all_trials' or a comma separated list of the beginning sequence of the trials without spaces)||task1,task2,!task3
# if a task is to be run again even if it has previously been completed, place a '!' before the task name
# examples:
# /mnt/nas2/JB/220721_ABCxGCaMP6s_tdTom/Fly1||001,002,003||pre_cluster,fictrac,cluster,post_cluster,denoise,dff,!video
# /mnt/nas2/JB/220721_ABCxGCaMP6s_tdTom/Fly1||001,002,003||df3d
