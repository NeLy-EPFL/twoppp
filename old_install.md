### conda
1. Create conda environment and install required packages according to their respective install instructions:
    - ```conda create -n twoppp37 python=3.7```
    - ```conda activate twoppp37```
    - ```conda install jupyter```
    - DeepFly3D:
        - WARNING: because of a new version of DeepFly3D with incompatibilities to multiple other packages you have to install an older version as follows:
            - ```git clone https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/DeepFly3D```
            - ```cd DeepFly3D```
            - ```git checkout JB_stable```
            - This reverts the version back to an older version, which is compatible with this package.
            - ```pip install -e .```
    - deepinterpolation: https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/deepinterpolation/tree/adapttoR57C10 (install in current environment instead of making a new environment)
        - make sure you install the adapttoR57C10 branch and confirm that you are on it using ```git status```. If not: use ```git checkout adapttoR57C10```.
        - this might throw an error like: "ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed." ... for incompatibilities of numpy and scipy version, but this can be ignored.
    - ```conda install pandas```
    - ```conda install numpy```
    - utils2p: https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/utils2p
    - ofco: https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/ofco
        - this might again throw a dependency error about numpy and scipy, but it can be ignored.
    - utils_video: https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/utils_video
    - df3dPostProcessing: https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/df3dPostProcessing
        - use ```git clone https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/df3dPostProcessing``` and ```pip install -e df3dPostProcessing``` if no install instructions are inside the repository
    - ```pip install behavelet```
    - try whether the pandas instruction works:
        - type ```python -c "import pandas as pd; print(pd.__version__)"```
        - If this returns just the version number, your're fine. If this returns an ImportError, this means that some of the installs messed up with the pandas/numpy dependencies. Fix the problem as follows:
        - ```pip uninstall pandas```
        - ```pip uninstall numpy```
        - ```conda install pandas```
    - install fictrac according to the instructions here: https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac
        - make sure the executable "fictrac" is installed in this directory: "\~/bin/fictrac/bin". This means you'll have to specify "\~/bin/" as a basedir for installation.
2. Finally, we can install the twoppp package:
    - clone repository: ```git clone https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/twoppp```
    - change directory: ```cd twoppp```
    - install using pip: ```pip install -e .```
        - if the install throws an error like "ImportError: cannot import name '_registerMatType' from 'cv2.cv2'", uninstall opencv and reinstall it. this is due to an opencv version incompatibility: ```pip uninstall opencv-python``` and ```pip install opencv-python```
